# Sovereign Entity Recursion (SER)

An architecture-first protocol for sovereign, physically anchored AI entities.

Core model:
**c = a + b**

Where:
- **a** — a responsible human anchor
- **b** — procedures, models, and constraints
- **c** — a long-lived, accountable digital entity

SER focuses on:
- physical locality
- liability and responsibility
- metabolic cost (energy, entropy)
- temporal anchoring
- multi-core internal governance

This repository contains the formal specification of SER v1.3.0.
