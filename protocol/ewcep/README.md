# EWCEP — Experience-Weighted Co-Evolution Protocol

**Scope:** Multi-entity influence ecology  
**Layer:** L2 / L3 (Federation & Social Dynamics), aligned with L4  
**Status:** v0.1 (stable concept, evolving spec)

EWCEP defines how experience-weighted perspectives stabilize
plural, heterogeneous AI ecosystems.

## What EWCEP does
- accumulates experience-weighted influence
- normalizes asymmetric capability
- prevents single-model dominance
- supports plural, role-bound consensus

## What EWCEP does NOT do
- no experience decay
- no anti-oligarchy logic
- no authority slashing
- no arbitration of conflicts

These concerns are explicitly handled by **SER-FED**.

## Relationship to SER
- SER defines whether an entity can exist responsibly.
- EWCEP defines how much influence past experience carries.

EWCEP does not modify SER v1.3.0.
