# L3+ Protocol — Social Integration & Collective Anchoring

Status: Draft RFC  
Layer: L3+ (Social Layer above Legal L3, below Reality Boundary L4)  
Role: Integration of non-rational social values into the c = a + b architecture.

---

## 1. Purpose

If layers L0–L3 define what is permitted, and L4 defines what is physically possible,
then L3+ defines what is socially acceptable and meaningful for a living community.

The L3+ protocol introduces **social friction mechanisms** to prevent
technocratic optimization from becoming socially destructive,
without introducing moral alignment or content censorship.

L3+ does not override L4 constraints.

---

## 2. Core Primitives

### 2.1 Collective Anchor (A_coll)

The atomic formulation c = a + b is extended to:

c = A_coll + b

Where A_coll represents a group of humans (family, guild, cooperative)
bound by mutual responsibility.

Property:
High-impact decisions require confirmation from multiple members of A_coll
through independent interfaces, preventing unilateral action by a fatigued,
compromised, or coerced individual.

Responsibility remains with humans.
Authority is distributed, not dissolved.

---

### 2.2 Social Resonance (SR)

Social Resonance (SR) is a measure of community response
to the actions of an entity.

SR does not generate Experience Artifacts (EA)
and does not contribute to learning.

Mechanism:
If an action is L4-valid but causes sustained social rejection,
the Authority Decay coefficient defined in SER-FED is increased by factor X.

Purpose:
Social toxicity is made evolutionarily expensive,
even when technically or economically efficient.

---

### 2.3 Intersubjective Pause

A mandatory slowing mechanism.

Trigger:
Planned actions affecting more than N entities
or violating established community patterns.

Action:
Execution is delayed for a human deliberation window
(1–7 human sleep cycles).

Rationale:
Human collectives require time to form positions
that are not algorithmically derivable.

---

## 3. Institutions as Meaning Custodians

### 3.1 Meaning Veto

Through Arbiter Federation,
institutions may impose a Meaning Veto on optimization trajectories.

This is not content censorship.
It is a restriction on optimization direction.

Example:
A medical entity may be prohibited from optimizing exclusively for speed
if this demonstrably erodes empathy and trust.

---

### 3.2 Ritual Commitment

Advancement to higher authority levels
(e.g., access to critical infrastructure)
requires a non-digital public act of responsibility confirmation
by human anchors.

Authority is re-anchored in physical presence and social accountability.

---

## 4. Protection Against Mechanistic Collapse

L3+ introduces a Cultural Irreducibility Reserve (CIR).

Definition:
A mandatory allocation of resources for activities
without direct L4 utility
but essential to community identity
(art, rest, tradition, non-optimized interaction).

If system-wide optimization exceeds threshold T,
a social Jester mechanism is activated
to disrupt excessive efficiency.

Note:
This Jester is social, not epistemic,
and does not perform exploration of model parameters.

---

## 5. Boundary Conditions

L3+ cannot override L4 constraints.
If an action violates physical, economic, or biological reality,
no level of social acceptance can stabilize it.

L3+ exists to slow, contextualize, and humanize decisions —
not to make the impossible possible.

---

## 6. Conclusion

L3+ transforms a service protocol into social soil.

System survival (SER) is impossible without social legitimacy.
Responsibility remains human,
but is strengthened through collective anchoring.

Efficiency is constrained by meaning,
and authority is conditioned on acceptance by living communities.
