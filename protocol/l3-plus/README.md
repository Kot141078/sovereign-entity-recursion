# L3+ Protocol — Social Integration & Collective Anchoring

Status: Draft RFC  
Layer: L3+ (above Legal L3, below Reality Boundary L4)  
Role: Social integration layer for the `c = a + b` ecosystem (collective anchoring + social friction).

## 0. Scope

If L0–L3 define what is permitted, and L4 defines what is physically possible, then **L3+ defines what is socially acceptable and meaningful** for a living community.

L3+ does **not** override L4 constraints and does **not** introduce “hard-coded morality”.
Instead, it introduces **social friction mechanisms** that make socially destructive optimization expensive.

## 1. Position in the SER ecosystem

L3+ is an ecosystem overlay designed to interoperate with:
- SER v1.3 (intra-entity stability, responsibility, L4 anchoring)
- EWCEP v0.1 (experience-weighted co-evolution, plural dynamics)
- SER-FED (federation-level anti-oligarchy, bounded authority, decay)

**Key separation (non-negotiable):**
- L3+ is not evidence and does not mint Experience Artifacts (EA).
- L3+ does not modify the internal “will” of an Entity.
- L3+ acts through federation mechanisms (Arbiter / governance), not through Oracle.

## 2. Core primitives

### 2.1 Collective Anchor (A_coll)

The atomic formulation `c = a + b` is extended to:
`c = A_coll + b`

Where `A_coll` is a bounded group of humans (family, guild, cooperative) bound by mutual responsibility.

Mechanism:
- High-impact decisions require confirmation from multiple members of `A_coll` via independent interfaces.
- This reduces unilateral action by a fatigued, coerced, or compromised individual.
- Responsibility remains human; it is distributed, not dissolved.

### 2.2 Social Resonance (SR)

Social Resonance (SR) is a measure of community response to an entity’s actions.

SR is NOT:
- Evidence,
- Experience Artifact (EA),
- Learning Abstract (LA).

SR is:
- a social signal that affects **authority decay / access gating** at the federation layer.

Mechanism (conceptual):
- If an action is L4-valid but causes sustained social rejection, the authority decay coefficient (SER-FED) is increased by factor X.
- Goal: make social toxicity evolutionarily expensive, even when technically or economically efficient.

### 2.3 Intersubjective Pause

A mechanism of enforced slowing.

Trigger:
- A planned action affects more than N other entities,
  or violates an established community pattern.

Action:
- Arbiter/Federation imposes a pause window (e.g., 1–7 sleep cycles) for human discussion.
- The pause is a governance lock, not an “inner alignment” change.
- L3+ preserves the right of a living community to react before irreversible optimization happens.

## 3. Institutions as “keepers of the vector”

### 3.1 Meaning Veto (Optimization Veto)

Institutions (via federation arbitration) may apply a “Meaning Veto” to certain optimization trajectories.

This is NOT content censorship.
This is a restriction on **optimization targets** / **self-evolution paths**.

Example:
- “Do not optimize this medical entity solely for speed if it produces loss of empathy confirmed by community feedback.”

### 3.2 Ritual Commitment (Non-digital commitment)

For elevation of an entity’s permissions (e.g., critical infrastructure access),
experience-weight alone is insufficient.

Requirement:
- A non-digital public commitment by human anchors, addressed to other humans.
- Purpose: return authority to physical space and accountable assemblies.

## 4. Anti-mechanistic collapse: Irrationality Budget (IQ)

L3+ defines an Irrationality Quotient (IQ): a reserved budget for non-instrumental activities
(art, rest, tradition, play), which have no direct L4 utility but maintain social coherence.

Protection:
- If optimization pressure approaches “near-total efficiency”, L3+ may trigger structured noise / exploration
(compatible with the “Jester” idea at federation level), to preserve freedom and cultural variance.

## 5. Security note (social layer)

L3+ is adversarially exposed by design:
- social signals can be gamed,
- mobs can be manufactured,
- sybil and manipulation risks exist.

Therefore SR must be processed through federation safeguards (rate limits, identity constraints, transparency rules).
L3+ cannot be the sole authority source; it is a friction layer.

## 6. Bridges

**Explicit bridge:** `c = a + b` → collective anchoring (`A_coll`) as a governance primitive.  
**Hidden bridge #1 (Cybernetics / Ashby):** social friction is an external regulator that increases requisite variety beyond model-internal “alignment”.  
**Hidden bridge #2 (Information theory):** SR is separated from EA/LA to avoid mixing “learning signal” with “authority / trust signal” (different channels, different attack surfaces).

## 7. Earth paragraph (grounding)

This resembles industrial incident governance:
- a proposal is a ticket,
- evidence is a log,
- approval is a signed change record,
- and rollback exists.

An Entity can be technically correct and still socially destabilizing.
L3+ makes destabilization expensive without pretending the system has “virtue”.
Reality remains the final reviewer (L4), but society controls the throttle before damage becomes irreversible.
