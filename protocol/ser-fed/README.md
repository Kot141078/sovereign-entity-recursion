# SER-FED — Federation Extension (Draft RFC)

**Scope:** Evolutionary stability & anti-oligarchy for long-lived ecosystems  
**Layer:** L2 (Federation Dynamics) + L4 (Reality Boundary)  
**Status:** Draft / RFC (not a release)

SER-FED is a **federation-layer extension** to the SER ecosystem.
It does **not** replace SER v1.3.0 and must not modify the SER core spec.

## What SER-FED does
- introduces **metabolic authority** (authority is rented from reality, not owned)
- applies **inequality-driven experience decay** (Gini-based decay)
- enforces **exploration budget** for cold-start (Jester protocol)
- adds **prediction bonds** (liability for authority)
- defines an **L4 witness protocol** (triangulated reality verification)
- hardens the system against **sybil / farm capture** at the federation edge

## Non-goals
- individual cognition design (SER core)
- model training and FL mechanics (handled by LA pipelines elsewhere)
- “ethical alignment” as a substitute for L4 constraints

## Relationship to EWCEP
EWCEP defines how influence accumulates from experience.
SER-FED defines how authority expires and renews under L4 selection pressure.

Together:
Experience → Authority → Reality → Decay → Renewal
