# Assumed Failure Modes (Normative Motivation for SER-FED)

SER-FED is designed under the assumption that specific failure modes are inevitable in any long-lived, multi-entity intelligent system operating under incentives.

The protocol does not attempt to prevent these failures through ethics, alignment, trust, or intent modeling.
Instead, they are treated as structural pressures and constrained architecturally.

## Authority Concentration (Oligarchy)
Early or coordinated actors accumulate disproportionate authority, forming stable oligarchies.
SER-FED assumes this outcome unless authority is made temporally unstable and costly.

## Speed Dominance (Optimization Tyranny)
Speed dominates decision-making absent friction.
SER-FED introduces pauses and inertia to prevent collapse under stress.

## Survival Externalization (Fragility Illusion)
Authority without exposure to loss leads to escalation.
SER-FED enforces survival constraints.

## Coordinated Falsification (Collusive Experience)
Experience claims are adversarial.
Learning signals are separated from authority signals.

## Design Implication
Authority is rented, not owned, and bounded by reality.

## Engineering Grounding
Without decay, systems fossilize.
Reality is used, not trusted.
